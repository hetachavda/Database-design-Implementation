# üöó Car Dealership Database System  

A comprehensive **SQL-based relational database** designed and implemented to manage the operations of a car dealership. This project demonstrates **database design, normalization, DDL/DML/DQL implementation, and advanced data retrieval queries**.

## üìå Project Overview  
The Car Dealership Database System provides an efficient way to store and manage data related to:  
- Customers  
- Cars  
- Employees  
- Dealerships  
- Inventory  
- Sales  
- Services  
- Payments  
- Warranties  

The system ensures **scalability, reliability, and data integrity** while supporting critical business processes such as inventory management, sales tracking, service scheduling, and customer relationship management.

## üéØ Objectives  
- Build a **robust and normalized** relational database.  
- Simplify **inventory, sales, and service management**.  
- Ensure **data accuracy** and eliminate redundancy.  
- Support **complex data queries** for reporting and decision-making.  
- Enable **future integration with Machine Learning tasks** (sales forecasting, customer trends, etc.).

## üèóÔ∏è Database Design  

### Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)  
Key entities and relationships include:  
- **Customers** ‚Üî Sales, Services, Warranty  
- **Cars** ‚Üî Inventory, Sales, Services, Warranty  
- **Employees** ‚Üî Sales  
- **Dealerships** ‚Üî Employees, Inventory  
- **Payments** ‚Üî Sales  

### Schema Highlights  
- **Customers (CustomerID, FirstName, LastName, Email, PhoneNumber, AddressID)**  
- **Cars (CarID, Make, Model, Year, Price, VIN)**  
- **Dealerships (DealershipID, Name, AddressID, Phone)**  
- **Employees (EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, Position, Department, DealershipID)**  
- **Inventory (InventoryID, CarID, DealershipID, StockQuantity)**  
- **Sales (SaleID, CustomerID, EmployeeID, CarID, SaleDate, SalePrice)**  
- **Services (ServiceID, CarID, CustomerID, ServiceDate, Description, Cost)**  
- **Payments (PaymentID, SaleID, PaymentMethod, Date, Amount)**  
- **Warranty (WarrantyID, CarID, CustomerID, StartDate, EndDate, CoverageDetails)**

## ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation  

- **DDL (Data Definition Language):**  
  Created normalized tables with appropriate constraints and foreign keys.  

- **DML (Data Manipulation Language):**  
  Inserted sample data for Customers, Cars, Dealerships, Employees, Sales, Services, Payments, and Warranties.  

- **DQL (Data Query Language):**  
  Advanced queries for retrieving insights such as:  
  - All customers and their car purchases  
  - Total sales by dealership  
  - Customers who purchased a specific model (e.g., Toyota Corolla)  
  - Inventory details across dealerships  
  - Aggregate service costs by customer

## üìä Sample Query  

```sql
-- Retrieve total sales by dealership
SELECT d.DealershipName, SUM(s.SalePrice) AS TotalSales
FROM Sales s
JOIN Inventory i ON s.CarID = i.CarID
JOIN Dealership d ON i.DealershipID = d.DealershipID
GROUP BY d.DealershipName;
